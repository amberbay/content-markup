  <h1>Editing Soft Copy</h1>


<p>Editing an electronic file and allowing the author to see the changes is called
<i>redlining</i> (also referred to as "editing online"). Basic housekeeping includes
removing all double spaces and converting hatches (a.k.a. "dumb quotes") to
quotation marks and apostrophes (a.k.a. "smart quotes"). The editor need not
point out these changes to the author.</P>

 <p style="text-indent: 40px">Changes to the structure and wording
of the text must be communicated to the author. A visual convention is needed
for showing <s>deleted</s> and <b class="redlining">added material.</b> <s>Words to be removed</s> are
typically struck out, and words <b class="redlining">added or substituted</b> can be <span class="underline">underlined</span>,
<mark>highlighted,</mark> or <b class="redlining">rendered in color</b>. A line in the margin indicates that a change
has been recommended. <b class="redlining">[Queries to the author are set off with brackets.]</b> <sup> A </sup> </P>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Underlining<u>,</u> or striking out; punctuation is visually confusing, so the editor
often strikes out an entire word<s>, or phrase,</s> <b class="redlining">-or phrase-</b>
and types in the freshly punctuated passage as an addition. To hyphenate a word such as <i><s>second rate</s></i>
<i><b =class"redlining">second-rate</i></b>, strike it out and add the hyphenated form. When converting hyphens
to en dashes (1914-18)-or changing double hyphens to em dashes-the editor
simply keys them in. Typographic styles such as <i>italic</i>, <b>boldface</b>, and small
capitals can also be changed directly.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Although redlining is wonderfully fluid
and direct, it can be dangerous. "The editor must scrupulously remove all
traces of the editing process before releasing the file for design and
typesetting. Potential disasters include words that are stuck together, a
missing , or a forgotten comment to the author <b =class"redlining">[Are you out of your
mother-loving mind?].</b></p>

<p><small>A. Queries to the author can also take the form of
footnotes. Identify these notes with letters, so they are not confused with
footnotes that belong to the text.</p></small>
